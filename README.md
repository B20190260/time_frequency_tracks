# Extract time-frequency tracks from a time–frequency distribution


Matlab code to extract time–frequency tracks, which represent instantaneous frequency
(IF) laws, from time–frequency distributions (TFDs).  Two methods presented, based on the
work of Rankine et al. (2007) and McAulay–Quatieri (1986); details in [references](#references).

# requirements: 

Matlab (R2013 or newer,
[Mathworks website](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/)). Also works in
[Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (version 4 or newer) but slow in
comparison to Matlab.



# use 
Example comparing both methods (code in <example\_IFest.m> but requires
[TFD toolbox](http://otoolej.github.io/code/memeff_TFDs/) from reference [4](#references)):
```matlab
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
% load test signal
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
b=load('testsignal_10dB.mat');
N=length(b.x); Ntime=512; 
x=b.x; Fs=b.Fs;

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
% generate TFD:
% (requires TFD code from http://otoolej.github.io/code/memeff_TFDs/)
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
tf=gen_TFD_EEG(x,Fs,Ntime,'sep');


% parameters for IF methods:
DELTA_SEARCH_FREQ=2;  % in Hz/s 
MIN_IF_LENGTH=6;      % in seconds


t_scale=(length(x)/b.Fs/Ntime);  f_scale=(1/size(tf,2))*(Fs/2);
delta_freq_samples=floor( (DELTA_SEARCH_FREQ/f_scale)*t_scale );
min_track_length=floor( MIN_IF_LENGTH/t_scale );


%---------------------------------------------------------------------
% Rankine et al. (2007) method:
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
lower_prctile_limit=98; 
it=tracks_LRmethod(tf,Fs,delta_freq_samples,min_track_length,lower_prctile_limit);

% plot:
figure(1); clf; hold all; 
for n=1:length(it)
    hlr=plot(it{n}(:,1).*t_scale,it{n}(:,2).*f_scale,'k+'); 
end


%---------------------------------------------------------------------
% McAulay and Quatieri (1986) method:
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
max_peaks=3;
it2=tracks_MCQmethod(tf,Fs,delta_freq_samples,min_track_length,max_peaks);

% plot:
for n=1:length(it2)
    hmcq=plot(it2{n}(:,1).*t_scale,it2{n}(:,2).*f_scale,'ro'); 
end
xlabel('time (seconds)'); ylabel('frequency (Hz)');
xlim([0 N/Fs]);
legend([hlr hmcq],{'LR method','MCQ method'});
```
